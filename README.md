# 1. The Robert Hooke Bibliography
The [Robert Hooke Bibliography](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17OXFChkDK9xKA5oxtE6vi-GzYVqKVxd3-gcuD7q9yiw/edit?usp=sharing) is a Google Sheet with 356 entries. Each row is dedicated to a separate text by Robert Hooke, and the columns indicate dates, pages, sources, publishing information, notes, etc. The texts from the bibliography that are currently in the Robert Hooke Corpus are marked in the 'In Corpus' column.
# 2. The Robert Hooke Corpus
The Robert Hooke Corpus contains 229 documents, 4079 paragraphs, and 885.332 tokens. It has been manually corrected for OCR errors. Two versions of the corpus are available: [The Robert Hooke Corpus in txt format](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TS7fM4wjH-79XxH0rML6zxLSPPXplvXr/view?usp=sharing) and [the Robert Hooke Corpus in FoLiA XML format](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sMwz98ZPcHkM0pNsbPdUsyfwn2KkNmi0/view?usp=sharing). The txt files are paragraph segmented by double newlines. The FoLiA files have first been tokenized (word, sentence, and paragraph) by [UCTO](https://webservices.cls.ru.nl/ucto).
# 3. Term-Concept Mappings
The term-concept mappings that were used in writing the thesis can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1srdBZElcMJlUF3-Hl6sdC08Vlv3dehmatInuPUdPd50/edit?usp=sharing). The sheet contains terms that are closely related (functionally synonymous or semantically similar) to subconcepts of the concept 'Baconianism'. Only lists C (Natural History), D (Bits of Theory), and F (False Appearances) have been used in this thesis.
# 4. Annotations
The annotations that were carried out in writing this thesis can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bOhLmXqF191UaVrM1yzJ9cyduzuKUldC9jga7nvwzZk/edit?usp=sharing). The annotations correspond to two separate annotation tasks:
1. *Research Question 1:* To what extent does Hooke’s conception of the (internal) sources of false appearances deviate from Bacon’s doctrine of the idols?
*Subquestion 1a:* Is at least one of Bacon’s four idols represented in this paragraph?
*Subquestion 1b:* Does Hooke introduce a source of false appearances that cannot be subsumed under one of Bacon’s idols?
*Subquestion 1c:* Does Hooke encourage the use of some method for detecting or avoiding the false appearances found in answering SQ1 and/or SQ2?
